# Usage

Make sure you have mlx insalled on your mac...I know I am sorry, we only support mac...then run make and after the executable is made run the program as follows:

./RT SCENE.xml

where SCENE is your desired scene to render

# Making a Scene

The scenes are parsed using an xml-like format. In general every scene needs at least a camera. There are a few example scenes under scenes
